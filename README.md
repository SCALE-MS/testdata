# SCALE-MS test and data files

Data and inputs for tests and such that we are keeping out of the main software repository

Please organize files into sensibly-named directories.

Please use `README.md` (or `README.rst` files according to your preference)
to describe any suggestions or constraints on how files should be used.

This is a public repository, so please cite sources where relevant.

We don't have a normative usage pattern for this repository (yet),
but it seems useful to keep data files from bloating the main software
repository. If `git` seems like the wrong tool (or GitHub the wrong host),
we can migrate this in the future.
